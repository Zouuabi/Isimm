# ISIMM

## Introduction

ISIMM is a backend application that provides a RESTful API for a university mobile app. The API allows users to perform various tasks related to their academic life, such as:

- Register and login with their credentials
- Select students and teachers by ID
- Retrieve the user's current studying classes
- Get the classes taught by a teacher
- Get each class's students
- Retrieve the classes' schedule
- And more

The API is built using dart_frog, a fast, minimalistic backend framework for Dart, and MySQL, a popular relational database management system. The API follows the JSON format for data exchange, and supports CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on the database.

The target audience and users of this project are university students, teachers, and administrators who want to access and manage their academic information and activities through a mobile app.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following software and hardware installed on your machine:

- Dart SDK: The software development kit for the Dart programming language. You can download it from [here](^1^).
- dart_frog: The backend framework for Dart that provides routing, middleware, and error handling features. You can install it using the following command:

```
dart pub global activate dart_frog
```

- MySQL: The relational database management system that stores and manages the data for the API. You can download it from [here](^2^).
- MySQL Workbench: The graphical user interface tool that allows you to create and manipulate the database schema and data. You can download it from [here](^3^).
- Postman: The API development platform that allows you to test and debug the API endpoints and responses. You can download it from [here](^4^).

To configure the project, you need to do the following steps:

- Clone the repo using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```

- Create a .env file in the root directory of the project, and add the following variables:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_NAME=isimm
PORT=8000
```

- Create a database named isimm in MySQL Workbench, and run the SQL script in the /db directory to create the tables and insert some sample data.
- Start the dart_frog server using the following command:

```
dart run bin/main.dart
```

## Usage
